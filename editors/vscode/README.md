# Zacess Themes

Eight high contrast code themes. Four match the [Zacess](https://zacess.com) reader, so a student sees
the same page in the reader and in the editor. Four more give the highest contrast a screen can show.
Every text and syntax colour keeps at least 7:1 contrast (WCAG AAA) on the background, comments
included. The current line is a visible band with plain text at 7:1 and every syntax colour at
4.5:1 or more over it. In the five high contrast themes and in the terminal a selection is a bold
block with every selected character in one colour at 7:1 or more. In Zacess Light, Dark and Cream
the editor keeps each token's colour inside a selection, at 4.5:1 or more. The current find match
is filled and outlined while the other matches, the word under the cursor and a matched bracket
are outlined only. Changed lines carry a gutter mark as well as their fill.

## Colour is never the only signal

- Keywords, control flow and markup tags are **bold**.
- Comments and parameters are *italic*.
- Invalid code is underlined.
- Tokens that often sit side by side differ in lightness or font style, not only in hue. Strings and
  numbers, added and removed lines and other red and green pairs are checked under simulated
  protanopia, deuteranopia and tritanopia.
