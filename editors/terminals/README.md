# Zacess for terminals

The eight Zacess themes for Terminal.app, iTerm2, Ghostty, kitty, WezTerm, Warp, Alacritty and
Windows Terminal. In the dark
themes every one of the 16 terminal colours keeps at least 7:1 contrast on the background, ANSI
black included: in Zacess Dark, Zacess Yellow on Black and Zacess High Contrast Dark it is a mid
grey, so text a program prints in black stays readable. Zacess Deep Contrast Dark keeps ANSI black true black for use as a
background. The light themes keep their coloured slots vivid at the 4.5:1 terminal allowance, since
at 7:1 they would read as black, while their black, white and grey slots keep 7:1.
[ACCESSIBILITY.md](../../ACCESSIBILITY.md#terminal-colours) explains both.

> [!NOTE]
> Zacess Light, Zacess Dark, Zacess Yellow on Black and Zacess Cream are also in the

The quickest route is the installer, run in the terminal you want to theme. It copies all eight
themes to the folder that terminal reads and prints the step that turns one on, without editing any
configuration file:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zacesshq/themes/main/install.sh | bash
```

| Terminal | Files | Install |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Terminal.app | [`terminal-app/`](terminal-app/) | Open a `.terminal` file once to add the profile, then choose it under **Terminal**, **Settings**, **Profiles** and select **Default** |
| iTerm2 | [`iterm2/`](iterm2/) | **Settings**, **Profiles**, **Colors**, then **Color Presets...** and **Import...**. Choose the `.itermcolors` file, then pick it from the same menu |
| Alacritty | [`alacritty/`](alacritty/) | Copy the file to `~/.config/alacritty/` and add `import = ["~/.config/alacritty/zacess-dark.toml"]` under `[general]` in `alacritty.toml` |
| kitty | [`kitty/`](kitty/) | Copy the file to `~/.config/kitty/` and add `include zacess-dark.conf` to `kitty.conf` |
| WezTerm | [`wezterm/`](wezterm/) | Copy the files to `~/.config/wezterm/colors/` and set `config.color_scheme = "Zacess Dark"` in `wezterm.lua` |
| Warp | [`warp/`](warp/) | Copy the files to `~/.warp/themes/` on macOS or `~/.local/share/warp-terminal/themes/` on Linux, then choose one under **Settings**, **Appearance**, **Themes** |
| Ghostty | [`ghostty/`](ghostty/) | Copy the files to `~/.config/ghostty/themes/` and add `theme = light:zacess-light,dark:zacess-dark` to the config to follow the system appearance |
| Windows Terminal | [`windows-terminal/zacess.json`](windows-terminal/zacess.json) | Run `irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zacesshq/themes/main/install.ps1 \| iex` in PowerShell, which copies the file to the `Fragments\Zacess` folder Windows Terminal reads. You can also add the eight objects to the `schemes` list in the settings file yourself. Then choose **Color scheme** under a profile's **Appearance** |

Every port sets the cursor and, where the terminal allows it, the character under the cursor and
the selected text colour from the palette. Terminal.app has no selected text colour, so its
selection is the background only selection with the terminal text at 7:1 over it. Warp's themes
set no cursor or selection colour, so Warp draws its own.

The full colour table with every measured ratio is in
[ACCESSIBILITY.md](../../ACCESSIBILITY.md#terminal-colours).
